# clitools
 A collection of simple utilities

Every now and then i would write something in small letters and then need to rewrite the entire thing in capital letters, so i just open up Python IDLE and do 'this is very serious'.upper(), and copy the output. or i would 'atpmirt'[::-1] and copy the output. This got too repetitive with having to do things like that and some more complicated things which got tedious to do in IDLE every time.

Now i can just do ```$python clitools.py invert atpmirt``` and itll just give me ```trimpta```

^This is just a simple example, you can really take it and use it for whatever small things you wanna incorporate into your workflow

# usage
 Get a list of utils: ```$python3 cliutils.py list -m```
